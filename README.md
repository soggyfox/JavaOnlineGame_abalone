# Client-server board game
We have built a client-server board game. 
To run the game run Server.java and then run multiple instances of Client.java which will connect the clients to the server. 
To run muliple clients select the run in parrallel option in your IDE. Alternatively you can run another instance of the client using a separate computer.  This will allow you to play with someone else who is using a different computer by connecting to each other on a server using the same port connection! 

Here each client can input there nickname.
If you are the first client to connect to the server you can select The game mode you wish to play. 
Other possible requests can also be made in accordance with our groups protocol
